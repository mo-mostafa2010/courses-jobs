# Integrated Course Management System

This project develops an adaptive e-learning platform where the learner is not only allowed to register courses and track their progress,
but it also provides them with tailored recommendations for job opportunities based on what they learn.
The project is implemented using Mongodb, Express js, React, Node js, and Javascript as web development tools.
